## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- Card from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Float
- Media queries

### What I learned

When i made this project, i got problems with centering the element card in the middle of the page and also with the responsive page when i use mobile device's width and the desktop's width, so i solve it with media screen so the css effect will work based on the width of the device, weather it's mobile or desktop. Although it still has some differences with the design but i'm confident with just this result.

```html
<h1>Some code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
/* media screen */
@media (min-width: 375px) {
  .card .row .your-result {
    margin-top: 15px;
  }
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .container {
    margin-top: 140px;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

For more update in the future, because i'm still learning javascript right now, i might use the json file with JQuery instead of writing it down manually later.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - This helped me to do the styling more easy. I really liked this bootstrap and will use it going forward.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com) - This is an amazing website which helped me to deploy my website into the internet. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning to use this website.
